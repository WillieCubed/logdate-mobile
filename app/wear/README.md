# `:app:wear`

**Android Wear OS companion application**

## Overview

Companion application for Wear OS devices that provides quick journaling capabilities directly from the wrist. Allows users to capture quick thoughts, voice notes, and view recent entries in a streamlined interface optimized for small screens.

## Current Status

**⚠️ Development Phase**: Build directory exists but implementation appears minimal. This module is planned for future development.

## Planned Features

### Core Functionality
- Quick note creation with voice-to-text
- Recent entries viewing
- Simple text input for brief entries
- Sync with main phone application

### Wear OS Specific Features
- Watch complications for quick access
- Haptic feedback for interactions
- Gesture-based navigation
- Always-on display support

### Health Integration
- Automatic activity logging
- Heart rate context for entries
- Steps and exercise correlation
- Sleep pattern integration
