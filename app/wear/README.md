# `:app:wear`

**Android Wear OS companion application**

## Overview

Companion application for Wear OS devices that provides quick journaling capabilities directly from the wrist. Allows users to capture quick thoughts, voice notes, and view recent entries in a streamlined interface optimized for small screens.

## Current Status

**🚀 Active Development**: Basic functionality implemented with modern Material 3 for Wear OS.

## Technology Stack

- **Material 3 for Wear OS**: Modern, expressive UI components designed specifically for wearables
- **Compose for Wear OS**: Declarative UI framework optimized for watch form factors
- **Dynamic Color**: Adapts to watch faces and system themes for cohesive visual integration

## Getting Started

To build and run the Wear OS app:

```bash
./gradlew :app:wear:installDebug
```

To test on the emulator, ensure you've set up a Wear OS emulator in Android Studio.

## Planned Features

### Core Functionality
- Quick note creation with voice-to-text
- Recent entries viewing
- Simple text input for brief entries
- Sync with main phone application

### Wear OS Specific Features
- Watch complications for quick access
- Haptic feedback for interactions
- Gesture-based navigation
- Always-on display support

### Health Integration
- Automatic activity logging
- Heart rate context for entries
- Steps and exercise correlation
- Sleep pattern integration
