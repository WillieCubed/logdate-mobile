# `:shared:activitypub`

**ActivityPub protocol implementation for federated features**

## Overview

Implements ActivityPub protocol for federated social features and potential future integration with decentralized platforms. Provides the foundation for social interactions and content federation.

## Architecture

```
ActivityPub Module
â”œâ”€â”€ Core Protocol Implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ Activity Streams
â”œâ”€â”€ Actor Types
â”œâ”€â”€ Object Types
â””â”€â”€ Client Integration
```

## Key Components

### Core Implementation
- `ActivityPubClient.kt` - Main ActivityPub client
- `LogdateServerBaseClient.kt` - LogDate-specific server integration

### Activity Streams
- `ActivityTypes.kt` - Activity definitions (Create, Update, Delete, etc.)
- `ActorTypes.kt` - Actor definitions (Person, Organization, etc.)
- `CoreTypes.kt` - Core ActivityPub types
- `ObjectTypes.kt` - Content object types
- `LinkTypes.kt` - Link and reference types
- `Properties.kt` - Common properties and metadata

## Features

### ActivityPub Protocol
- Full ActivityPub specification implementation
- JSON-LD serialization support
- Actor discovery and verification
- Activity delivery and federation

### Activity Streams
- Create, Update, Delete activities
- Follow, Like, Share interactions
- Collections and ordering
- Audience targeting

### Federation Support
- Cross-instance communication
- Content discovery
- Identity verification
- Protocol compliance

## Current Status

**ðŸš§ Early Development Phase**

This module is in early development and represents future plans for federated features. The basic protocol structures are in place but full implementation is pending.

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Kotlinx Serialization**: JSON-LD serialization
- **Ktor Client**: HTTP communication
- **Kotlinx Coroutines**: Async operations

## Protocol Support

### ActivityPub Specification
- W3C ActivityPub recommendation compliance
- Activity Streams 2.0 vocabulary
- JSON-LD context support
- HTTP signature verification

### Federation Features
- Actor discovery via WebFinger
- Activity delivery to followers
- Inbox and outbox collections
- Public and private activities
