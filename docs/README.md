# LogDate Documentation

This index lists where each kind of documentation lives. Module-specific documentation lives in each
module's `README.md`; start with [`app/README.md`](../app/README.md) and the module READMEs under
`client/`.

## Where to look

| Folder | What it holds | Start with |

| [`feature-design/`](feature-design/) | Product behavior and design decisions for a feature | [Android OS integration](feature-design/android-os-integration.md) |
| [`testing/`](testing/) | How to write and run each kind of test | [Testing introduction](testing/introduction.md), [Screenshot tests](testing/screenshot-tests.md) |

| [`launch/`](launch/) | Release gates and launch readiness | [Android public release](launch/android-public-release.md) |
| [`environment/`](environment/) | Setting up a development machine | [Setup](environment/setup.md) |

## Reference highlights

- [Android OS integration guide](reference/android/os-integration.md): shortcuts, tiles, Live Updates,
  widgets, bubbles, keyboard and pointer input, desktop windowing, and AppFunctions
- [Home workspace](reference/architecture/home-workspace.md): the adaptive panel system behind Home
- [Navigation architecture](navigation-architecture.md)
- [Android media storage](reference/android-media-storage.md)
- [Google Play publishing](reference/google-play-publishing.md)
- [Commit messages](reference/standards/commit-messages.md) and [commit scopes](reference/standards/commit-scopes.md)

## Writing documentation

- **Write for someone new to the codebase.** Explain the concept before the API, say why a rule
  exists, and link to the code by path.
- **Keep docs next to their change.** A commit that changes behavior updates the guide, the
  checklist row, and the module README in the same commit.
- **Show, don't describe.** Embed committed screenshots instead of describing what a screen looks
  like.
- **Write commands that run.** Use `./run` commands where they exist. Every device command must
  target an emulator or a Gradle Managed Device, never a physical device.
