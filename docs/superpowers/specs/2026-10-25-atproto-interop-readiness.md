# AT Protocol interoperability readiness

Part of the LogDate on the AT Protocol initiative. The umbrella design is
[LogDate on the AT Protocol](./2026-10-09-logdate-atproto-interoperability-design.md).

This document audits how ready LogDate is to work with the rest of the AT Protocol network (the
Atmosphere) in both directions, and lists exactly what is left:

- **Direction A: LogDate as a PDS for other services.** Someone whose identity LogDate hosts signs
  in to Bluesky or another Atmosphere app, and that app reads and writes their public records on
  LogDate's server.
- **Direction B: other services as a PDS for LogDate.** Someone who already has an Atmosphere
  identity, such as `williecubed.me` on Bluesky's servers, signs in to LogDate with it. LogDate
  writes their public LogDate records to that existing server and stores their private journal in
  LogDate Cloud.

The goal comes from one constraint: be ready for a clean cutover, where nothing permanent goes
public until it is right, without delaying either direction any longer than that requires.

## A short glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| DID | A permanent account identifier, such as `did:plc:…`. Handles can change; the DID can't. |
| DID document | What a DID resolves to: the account's handle, its signing key, and the address of its PDS. |
| PLC directory | `plc.directory`, the public, append-only log that `did:plc` identities are published to. Nothing in it can be deleted. |
| Rotation key | A key allowed to sign changes to a `did:plc` identity. Earlier keys in the list outrank later ones for 72 hours. |
| PDS | Personal data server. It hosts an account's repository and signs the person in to apps. LogDate's server is one. |
| Repository | An account's public records, stored as a signed Merkle search tree (MST) and exported as a CAR file. |
| Relay | A service that follows many PDSes and passes their changes on as one stream. |
| AppView | A service that reads the network and builds app views, such as Bluesky's timelines (`api.bsky.app`). |
| Service proxying | A PDS forwarding an app's request to an AppView on the person's behalf, with a short-lived token it signs. |
| OAuth client | An app that asks a person's PDS for permission to act for them. |
| DPoP | A rule that every OAuth token is bound to a key only the app has, so a stolen token is useless on its own. |
| Lexicon and NSID | A Lexicon is a published schema. Its NSID, such as `app.logdate.actor.profile`, names it. |

## Summary

**Neither direction works end to end today, but both are closer than they look.**

- **Direction A** has a correct repository, event stream and OAuth authorization server, and
  passkey sign-in on the authorization page. What it lacks are the parts general-purpose apps
  depend on: no third-party app can write any collection, `getSession` refuses OAuth tokens, there is no service
  proxying, no preferences, no service auth, DPoP nonces break across server instances, and browser
  apps are blocked by CORS. No identity can be used anywhere until it is published, and the existing
  publishing command publishes every account at once, which the opt-in decision rules out.
- **Bluesky's official app can't sign in to a passkey-only PDS at all.** As of 2026-10-25 its sign-in
  is password-only (details below). Until Bluesky ships OAuth sign-in for other servers, or LogDate
  decides to offer app passwords, a LogDate-hosted identity can be used with OAuth apps such as
  Leaflet, teal.fm, Grain or Blacksky, but not with the official Bluesky app.
- **Direction B** has a complete, well-tested confidential OAuth client in
  `shared/atproto-oauth-client`, but the server doesn't use it yet. The server has no concept of an
  account whose identity lives elsewhere. Direction B needs nothing published by LogDate: the first
  public records it would write use the Standard.site schemas, which are already final. **It is the
  fastest path to real interoperability.**
- **Several cutover items aren't final yet.** These include the PDS address in DID documents, the
  server's rotation key, the publication model and handle resolution for unpublished accounts, the
  first public LogDate lexicons and their `_lexicon` DNS authority, and record key generation. The
  [cutover-freeze checklist](#cutover-freeze-checklist) lists each one.

## Decisions this audit applies

- **Identities are private by default.** Making one public is each person's explicit, informed
  choice, and nothing is ever published to `plc.directory` automatically. This replaces the umbrella
  design's "every LogDate account becomes a public Atmosphere identity once the safeguards are in
  place".
- **People with an existing Atmosphere identity link it** instead of getting a second one.
- **Private journal data never goes into a public repository.**
- **Sign-in is passkey-only.** The server refuses password `createSession` and `createAccount`.

## How this was checked

Everything below was run on `main` on 2026-10-25.

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| AT Protocol library tests | `./gradlew :shared:atproto-{syntax,crypto,identity,lexicon,plc,repo,pds,oauth-client,xrpc,pds-runtime}:jvmTest` | 383 passed, 2 skipped. The skipped tests are the live Bluesky tests, which run only with `ATPROTO_OAUTH_LIVE=1`. |
| Repositories and events checked by the reference implementation | `./gradlew :shared:atproto-repo:jvmTest --rerun` | 81 passed. `ReferenceRepoVerificationTest` (7 tests) and `ReferenceEventVerificationTest` (7 tests) hand exports and `#commit` events to `@atproto/repo` 0.11.0 through `tools/atproto-repo-verify`. |
| Server AT Protocol, OAuth, identity, XRPC, recovery key, space and server info tests | `./gradlew :server:test --tests 'app.logdate.server.{atproto,oauth,identity}.*' --tests 'app.logdate.server.routes.{Xrpc,OAuth,Identity,RecoveryKey,SpaceXrpc,ServerInfo}*'` | 478 passed in 57 classes. The PostgreSQL race tests in `app.logdate.server.database` were not part of this run. |
| Passkey OAuth sign-in end to end | `./gradlew :integration:server-client-e2e:test --tests '*PasskeyAtprotoSignInE2ETest*'` | 3 passed |
| Identity publishing rehearsal | `./run identity:rehearse` | Passed all seven steps against the reference PLC directory on loopback, including the wrong-PDS-address recovery. |
| Lexicon lint and conformance | `node tools/lexicon-check/check.mjs` and `node tools/lexicon-check/conformance.mjs` | Passed: 38 record types, 3 space declarations, 2 permission sets, 0 published schemas, 556 conformance cases. |
| Production discovery documents | `curl` against `cloud.logdate.app` and `logdate.app` | The OAuth metadata and protected-resource documents are served. `describeServer` names `did:web:logdate.app`, but `https://logdate.app/.well-known/did.json` answers `404`, so the server's own DID doesn't resolve. |

### Official interop test vectors

The repository doesn't use [bluesky-social/atproto-interop-tests](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto-interop-tests)
(latest commit 2026-07-01) anywhere. For this audit they were run once against the Kotlin library
through a temporary test that was not committed.

| Vector file | Result | What differs |
|---|---|---|
| `syntax/handle_*` | 71/71 valid accepted, 48/48 invalid rejected | — |
| `syntax/recordkey_*`, `syntax/tid_*`, `syntax/aturi_*`, `syntax/datetime_*` | All accepted and rejected correctly | — |
| `syntax/did_*` | 22/24 valid accepted, 14/18 invalid rejected | Rejects `did:method::::val` and `did:method::.`. Accepts `did:method:val%`, `did:m123:val` and a DID over the 2 KB limit. |
| `syntax/nsid_*` | 24/25 valid accepted, 27/27 invalid rejected | Rejects a long NSID that is within the limits. |
| `syntax/language_*` | 18/18 valid accepted, 3/7 invalid rejected | Accepts `jaja`, `JA`, `j` and `a-DE`. |
| `syntax/cid_*` | 2/8 valid accepted, 7/10 invalid rejected | Accepts only base32 CIDs, and accepts CIDs with spaces before, after or inside them. |
| `crypto/signature-fixtures.json` | 6/6 | — |
| `crypto/w3c_didkey_P256.json`, `w3c_didkey_K256.json` | 1/1 and 5/5 (public keys decoded and re-encoded) | Deriving the key from the private bytes was not checked. |
| `data-model/data-model-fixtures.json` | 3/3 (DAG-CBOR bytes and CID) | — |
| `data-model/data-model-valid.json` | 4/5 | Refuses the "float, but integer-like" case. |
| `data-model/data-model-invalid.json` | 4/12 rejected | The codec doesn't check data-model rules: a top-level non-object, a missing or wrong `$type`, a malformed blob, and extra fields beside `$bytes` or `$link` all encode. |
| `mst/key_heights.json`, `mst/common_prefix.json` | 9/9 and 13/13 | — |
| `lexicon/lexicon-valid.json`, `lexicon-invalid.json` | 2/3 and 6/7 | The Kotlin parser rejects a `permission-set` and accepts "defined unknown". LogDate's own schemas are linted by the reference implementation instead, so this affects library users, not LogDate's lint. |
| `lexicon/record-data-valid.json`, `record-data-invalid.json` | 2/3 and 50/50 | Rejects the "full" record. |
| Not run | — | `firehose/commit-proof-fixtures.json` (its keys aren't collection/rkey paths, which the MST API requires), `syntax/*_parse_invalid.txt`, `syntax/uri_*` and `syntax/atidentifier_*`. |

## Direction A: LogDate as a PDS for other services

### Can Bluesky's app sign in to a third-party PDS without a password?

Not today. Checked on 2026-10-25:

- The official app (social-app 1.137.0 on `main`) depends on `@atproto/lex-password-session` and
  has no OAuth client dependency
  ([package.json](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/blob/main/package.json)). Its sign-in
  flow lets a person pick a hosting provider and then asks for a password.
- The request to add OAuth sign-in is open
  ([social-app#10403](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/issues/10403), opened
  2026-05-02).
- A change merged on 2026-10-23
  ([social-app#12076](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/pull/12076)) says that
  "bsky.app sign-in is moving to OAuth on `bsky.social/oauth/authorize`". That is Bluesky's own
  authorization server, which only serves Bluesky-hosted accounts. Nothing public says when, or
  whether, the app will accept other servers' authorization servers.
- Apps that sign in with OAuth include Leaflet and teal.fm (both depend on `@atproto/oauth-client`),
  Grain, Frontpage, and Blacksky's fork of the Bluesky app. Whether each also offers password sign-in
  wasn't checked. Blacksky asks
  for `atproto transition:generic transition:email transition:chat.bsky identity:handle
  account:email?action=manage account:status?action=manage`
  ([oauth-config.ts](https://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/blacksky.community)).

So a passkey-only LogDate account can reach OAuth apps once the gaps below are closed. The official
Bluesky app needs one of these two things:

- Bluesky ships OAuth sign-in for other servers.
- LogDate offers app passwords, which the
  [passkey sign-in design](./2026-10-19-passkey-atproto-sign-in-design.md#decision) deferred "until
  someone needs a specific password-only app". The Bluesky app is that app. An app password is a
  random secret LogDate generates, limited to repository and proxy use, never one a person chooses.
  It would still mean `createSession` accepts a secret, so it needs an explicit decision.

Even after sign-in, Bluesky clients call `getSession`, `getPreferences`, `putPreferences` and
`getServiceAuth` on the PDS. They send every `app.bsky.*` call with
`atproto-proxy: did:web:api.bsky.app#bsky_appview`, and every `chat.bsky.*` call with
`did:web:api.bsky.chat#bsky_chat`. Those are required for any Bluesky-compatible client, whichever
way it signs in.

### Gap table

Status means: **done**, the requirement is met in code on `main`; **partial**, some of it is met;
**missing**, nothing implements it.

| Requirement | Spec reference | Status | Evidence | Work needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A person's DID resolves in the public directory | [did:plc](https://web.plc.directory/spec/v0.1/did-plc), [DID](https://atproto.com/specs/did) | Partial | Genesis operations are signed and stored in `hosted_plc_operations`. Publishing is off in production (`ATPROTO_PLC_PUBLISH_ENABLED` is absent from `infra/terraform/production.tfvars`), and the rehearsal passes. | Replace bulk publishing with a per-person opt-in (A-2). Until a DID resolves, no app can sign the person in, because OAuth clients resolve the DID to find the PDS. |
| Publication is each person's explicit, informed choice | Decision in this initiative | Missing | `IdentityPublishingCommand` and `docs/runbook/identity-publishing.md` publish every account. With publishing on, `PlcIdentityService` sends each new identity as it is created, and a lost provisioning race also sends an unused DID (`docs/reference/handle-resolution.md`). | Add a per-account publication state and a Publish action with plain copy and a passkey step-up. Publish only accounts in that state. Change the command so it can never publish an account that hasn't chosen to. Never send a DID that lost a race. |
| The person's recovery key outranks the server's | [did:plc](https://web.plc.directory/spec/v0.1/did-plc) | Done | `rotationKeys = [recoveryKey, serverKey]` in `PlcIdentityService`. The app registers the key without opening the phrase. `ATPROTO_RECOVERY_KEYS_ENABLED=true` in production. | Make a registered recovery key a precondition of the Publish action. |
| The server's rotation key is separate from the repository signing key | [Account](https://atproto.com/specs/account), reference PDS practice | Missing | `provisionHostedDid` lists the account's own repository signing key as the server's rotation key. That key signs every commit, so a leak of one hot key also lets someone rewrite the identity. | Use one server rotation key stored in a key manager (Cloud KMS). Put it in genesis for new identities, and in an update operation before publishing for existing ones. |
| Handles resolve both ways | [Handle](https://atproto.com/specs/handle) | Partial | The website answers `https://<handle>/.well-known/atproto-did` through `resolveHandle`. That works today for every account, published or not, so it confirms that an account exists and who it belongs to. The production canary monitor is commented out. | Resolve only published identities. Set the canary (`handle_resolution_monitor`) when the first identity is published. |
| The server's own DID resolves | [DID](https://atproto.com/specs/did) | Missing | `describeServer` names `did:web:logdate.app`, and `https://logdate.app/.well-known/did.json` answers `404`. | Serve the document from the website, or use `did:web:cloud.logdate.app` served by the server. The DID is the `aud` that service-auth tokens are addressed to. |
| Changing handles, including custom domains | [Handle](https://atproto.com/specs/handle), `com.atproto.identity.updateHandle` | Missing | No route exists, and LogDate has no handle change screen. | Add a handle change flow and `updateHandle`. Needed for people who want their own domain. Not needed to start. |
| `describeServer` | [XRPC](https://atproto.com/specs/xrpc) | Done | Production answers with the server DID and `logdate.app`. | — |
| Password sign-in refused | Decision in this initiative | Done | `createSession` and `createAccount` answer `400` (`XrpcRoutes.kt`, `XrpcPasswordRefusalTest`). | Decide on app passwords for password-only apps (see above). |
| `getSession` works for OAuth apps | [OAuth](https://atproto.com/specs/oauth), `com.atproto.server.getSession` | Missing | `getSession` only accepts `Bearer` AT Protocol session tokens (`requireBearerToken`, `AtprotoSessionService.getSession`). A DPoP-bound OAuth token gets `401`. | Accept DPoP tokens. Answer `did`, `handle`, `didDoc`, `active` and `status`, and `email` only with `transition:email` or `account:email`. |
| Account status methods | [Account](https://atproto.com/specs/account) | Partial | `getRepoStatus` and `#account` events report status (`PublicRepoStandingTest`). `checkAccountStatus`, `activateAccount` and `deactivateAccount` don't exist. | Add them. Migration and clients use them. |
| Service auth tokens | [XRPC: inter-service auth](https://atproto.com/specs/xrpc) | Missing | No `getServiceAuth` route. | Add `getServiceAuth`, signing with the account's `#atproto` key and setting `aud`, `lxm` and an `exp` of 60 seconds or less. Bluesky uses it for video upload and age assurance, and migration needs it. |
| Service proxying (`atproto-proxy`) | [XRPC: service proxying](https://atproto.com/specs/xrpc) | Missing | No code reads the header. | Resolve the service DID and fragment, mint a service-auth token, forward the request, and pass `atproto-accept-labelers` and `atproto-content-labelers` through. Refuse to proxy account-management methods. Proxy `com.atproto.moderation.createReport`. Read-after-write can wait. |
| `app.bsky.actor.getPreferences` and `putPreferences` | Reference PDS behaviour; [Bluesky docs](https://docs.bsky.app) | Missing | No route. | Store one preferences document per account on the PDS. Don't proxy it. |
| OAuth authorization server metadata | [OAuth](https://atproto.com/specs/oauth) | Done | Production serves every required field with the required values: PAR required, `iss` returned, client metadata documents, S256, `private_key_jwt` and `none`, ES256 for DPoP. | — |
| Scopes beyond `atproto` and `transition:generic` | [Permission](https://atproto.com/specs/permission), [permission sets](https://atproto.com/guides/permission-sets) | Missing | `OAuthScopes.supported` lists only those two, and drops every other scope at PAR. | Add `transition:email` and `transition:chat.bsky` first, because Bluesky-compatible clients ask for them. Then parse and enforce `repo:`, `rpc:`, `blob:`, `account:` and `identity:` permissions, and resolve `include:` permission sets with the caching rules. |
| Passkey on the authorization page | [Passkey sign-in design](./2026-10-19-passkey-atproto-sign-in-design.md) | Partial | Built and tested (3 end-to-end tests pass). `LOGDATE_OAUTH_PASSKEY_SIGN_IN_ENABLED` is not set in production. | Turn it on in production once A-2 exists. The issuer, `cloud.logdate.app`, is inside the relying party, `logdate.app`. |
| DPoP nonces work across server instances | [OAuth: DPoP](https://atproto.com/specs/oauth), [RFC 9449 §8–9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9449) | Missing | `OAuthNonceService` makes a random nonce per process, and only the current one is accepted. Production scales from zero to ten instances (`infra/terraform/variables.tf`), so a nonce from one instance fails on the next, and every cold start invalidates every nonce. | Derive nonces from a shared secret and the time window, and accept the previous, current and next windows. |
| Resource server asks for a fresh nonce correctly | [RFC 9449 §9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9449#section-9) | Missing | On a stale nonce, XRPC answers `401` with a JSON body and a `DPoP-Nonce` header, but no `WWW-Authenticate: DPoP error="use_dpop_nonce"`. RFC 9449 asks resource servers for that header, and the reference `@atproto/oauth-client` looks for it before retrying. | Send `WWW-Authenticate` on every DPoP `401`, and `DPoP-Nonce` on every response. |
| Browser apps can call the server | [OAuth: CORS](https://atproto.com/specs/oauth) | Partial | CORS is only installed for `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (`NetworkEdge.kt`), and it doesn't allow the `DPoP` header or expose `DPoP-Nonce`. | Allow any origin, without credentials, on `/xrpc/*`, `/oauth/par`, `/oauth/token`, `/oauth/revoke` and `/.well-known/oauth-*`. Allow `DPoP` and `atproto-proxy`, and expose `DPoP-Nonce` and `WWW-Authenticate`. |
| Other apps can write their own collections | [Repository](https://atproto.com/specs/repository) | Missing | `OAuthScopes.collectionsOpenToApps` is empty. OAuth apps see empty lists and get `403` on writes. Uploads are refused. `describeRepo` hides public LogDate collections too. | For accounts whose journal is in the personal space, open every collection outside `app.logdate.*` and `studio.hypertext.logdate.*` instead of a fixed list. Leave legacy-sync accounts closed. Open uploads with size limits, streaming and the account's quota, and record which records refer to each blob. |
| Writes are checked against the data model and schemas | [Data model](https://atproto.com/specs/data-model), [Lexicon](https://atproto.com/specs/lexicon) | Partial | LogDate's public collections and Standard.site records are validated (`docs/reference/repository-event-stream.md`). Other collections are stored as sent, and the codec accepts 8 of the 12 invalid data-model vectors. | Check data-model rules on every write: a top-level object, a string `$type`, the blob shape, and no floats. Return `validationStatus`. Validate known Lexicons when the schema is available. |
| `applyWrites` | `com.atproto.repo.applyWrites` | Missing | No route. `ApiTags.kt` still says so. | Add it, with the same checks as the single-record methods. Bluesky's app uses it. |
| Repository format: commit version 3, TID revisions, MST, low-S signatures | [Repository](https://atproto.com/specs/repository) | Done | The reference verifier accepts exports and later commits signed with K-256 and P-256, and checks that `rev` is a valid, increasing TID. | — |
| Sync reads (`getRepo`, `getLatestCommit`, `getRepoStatus`, `listRepos`, `getBlob`) | [Sync](https://atproto.com/specs/sync) | Done | Served without sign-in for shown repositories only (`PublicRepoReads.kt`). | — |
| `sync.getRecord`, `sync.getBlocks`, `sync.listBlobs` | [Sync](https://atproto.com/specs/sync) | Missing | No routes. | Add `listBlobs` (migration needs it) and `getRecord` (record proofs). `getBlocks` can follow. |
| Event stream (sync 1.1) | [Event stream](https://atproto.com/specs/event-stream), [Sync](https://atproto.com/specs/sync) | Partial | `#commit` with `prevData`, `#sync`, `#identity` and `#account` events verify with the reference implementation. The stream is on in staging and off in production. It has never been followed by a real relay. | Run a local relay (Bluesky's `indigo`) against staging and check that it ingests commits and status changes. |
| Relays are asked to crawl | `com.atproto.sync.requestCrawl` | Partial | `RelayCrawler` exists. `ATPROTO_RELAY_HOSTS` is set in neither staging nor production. | Set it in staging with the relay test, and in production at the first publication. |
| Blobs | [Blob](https://atproto.com/specs/blob) | Partial | Blob CIDs use the raw codec with SHA-256 (`LogDatePdsBlobStore`). Only LogDate app tokens can upload. | Open uploads to apps, as above. Strip location metadata from published images before upload, because a blob's CID is fixed by its bytes. |
| Account migration in and out | [Account migration](https://atproto.com/guides/account-migration) | Missing | None of `importRepo`, `listMissingBlobs`, `getRecommendedDidCredentials`, `submitPlcOperation`, `requestPlcOperationSignature` or `signPlcOperation` exists. A migrating `createAccount` includes an existing DID and a service-auth token, and today every `createAccount` is refused. | Add it after the core gaps. Accept `createAccount` only with an existing DID and valid service auth, then require a passkey before the account becomes active. |
| Labels | [Label](https://atproto.com/specs/label) | Missing | Depends on proxying. | Pass the label headers through when proxying. A PDS doesn't apply labels itself. |
| `resolveHandle` for handles on other servers | `com.atproto.identity.resolveHandle` | Partial | Answers only for local handles. | Resolve other handles through DNS and HTTPS, or proxy to the AppView. |
| Syntax matches the interop vectors | [atproto-interop-tests](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto-interop-tests) | Partial | See [the vector results](#official-interop-test-vectors). | Fix DID, NSID, language and CID parsing. Add the vectors to CI as a library test. |

### Top five gaps for Direction A

1. Per-person publication: the opt-in state and Publish action, the command change, and handle
   resolution only for published identities. Without this, no identity can be used anywhere.
2. Apps can't use the repository: no open collections, no uploads, no `applyWrites`, and
   `getSession` refuses OAuth tokens.
3. No service proxying, service auth or preferences, which every Bluesky-compatible client needs.
4. DPoP nonces fail across instances and there is no `WWW-Authenticate` header, so reference OAuth
   clients fail intermittently in production.
5. CORS blocks browser apps.

## Direction B: other services as a PDS for LogDate

The design is already set by the umbrella spec: LogDate's server is a confidential OAuth client (a
backend-for-frontend), the external identity is linked to the LogDate account, the data home stays
LogDate Cloud, and passkeys still protect devices and keys.

### How it fits the sealed personal space and the data home

- **Private data needs no new storage.** A personal space is named by its owner's DID,
  `(ownerDid, app.logdate.space.personal, self)`. The space store and the `DataHome` interface
  (`shared/space`) work for any DID. LogDate Cloud stores sealed records and blobs for an external
  DID the same way it does for a hosted one. The person's own PDS never sees private data.
- **Public records go to the person's PDS.** Profile and published stories are written with the
  OAuth session to their PDS, not to a repository on LogDate. LogDate shows no repository, event
  stream or handle for that account.
- **Linking changes a DID that sealed records depend on.** The sealed envelope's authenticated data
  is `app.logdate.crypto.sealed|1|<space URI>|<author DID>|<sealed rkey>`
  (`SealedRecordCodec.kt`). The space URI contains the owner's DID. An existing account that moved
  into its personal space under a hosted DID can't simply change its DID to the external one, or
  every envelope fails to open. Either the device re-seals every record under the new DID, using the
  same download-verify-switch machinery as the move into personal spaces, or the account
  continues to use its hosted DID as an internal space owner forever. Re-sealing gives each person one DID and makes a
  future move onto Atproto Spaces simple. While LogDate has a single user, the cost is one device
  migration. This needs a decision before more accounts move into personal spaces.
- **The account's unused hosted identity is retired.** For someone who links, the hosted `did:plc`
  that LogDate created is never published and is marked so no command can publish it.

### Gap table

| Requirement | Spec reference | Status | Evidence | Work needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Confidential OAuth client: resolution, PAR, PKCE, DPoP, `private_key_jwt`, `iss` check, refresh and revocation | [OAuth](https://atproto.com/specs/oauth) | Done in the library | `shared/atproto-oauth-client`: 86 tests pass against a specification-built mock with independent JOSE checks. A live test reaches Bluesky's authorization server up to the client metadata fetch. Includes server-side request forgery protection and a single data server client. | — |
| Server uses the client | — | Missing | Nothing outside the library depends on `atproto-oauth-client`. | Wire it into the server with Koin. |
| Client metadata document and keys | [OAuth: client metadata](https://atproto.com/specs/oauth) | Missing | — | Serve `oauth.clientMetadataJson()` at a permanent `https` client ID, with the JWKS. Store the ES256 client key in Secret Manager. Decide the client ID now (see the checklist). |
| Sign-in and callback routes, and the return to the app | [OAuth](https://atproto.com/specs/oauth) | Missing | — | `GET /atproto/sign-in?handle=…` and `GET /oauth/callback` on the server. The callback ends in an App Link or Universal Link that includes a one-time code the app exchanges for a LogDate session. |
| Session and state storage across instances | Library README | Missing | The library only defines `OAuthStateStore`, `OAuthSessionStore` and `OAuthSessionLock`. | PostgreSQL stores, encrypted with the signing-key key-encryption key, with expiry on pending sign-ins, and a lock backed by a PostgreSQL advisory lock. |
| Accounts whose identity lives elsewhere | — | Missing | `AtprotoIdentityService.ensureIdentity` provisions a hosted DID for any account without a signing key, and many routes call it. | Add an `external` identity kind. Skip provisioning, handle resolution, the public repository and the event stream for it. Take the handle from the verified DID document and refresh it at each session restore. |
| Linking an existing LogDate account | Umbrella design, "Continue with Bluesky" | Missing | — | Link only from a session confirmed with a passkey. Allow one external DID per account and one account per DID, and show an actionable error for a DID linked elsewhere. Re-seal the personal space, or use the hosted DID as its owner (see above). Retire the unused hosted DID. |
| Signing up with an external identity stays passkey-protected | Passkey-only decision | Missing | — | After the first OAuth sign-in, create the LogDate passkey before any data syncs. Later sign-ins use the passkey. The external OAuth session is only for writing public records and reading. |
| Scopes LogDate asks for | [Permission](https://atproto.com/specs/permission) | Missing | — | `atproto repo:site.standard.publication repo:site.standard.document repo:app.logdate.actor.profile blob:image/*`. Fall back to `transition:generic` on servers without fine-grained permissions. Switch to `include:app.logdate.authPublish` only after LogDate's lexicons and their `_lexicon` records are published. |
| Writing public records to the person's PDS | [Repository](https://atproto.com/specs/repository) | Missing | Story publishing isn't built in the apps yet. | A public-record writer with two implementations: the local repository for hosted accounts, and the OAuth session for external ones. Record every write in an outbound-write audit (the umbrella design's push audit). |
| Reading the social graph | Umbrella design, Friends from the Atmosphere | Missing | — | Follows and blocks are public. Read them through the AppView's public API or the person's repository, not with the OAuth session. |
| Sessions that end | OAuth token lifetimes | Missing | The library raises `OAuthSessionEndedException`. | Show a "Sign in to Bluesky again to publish" state in the apps. Private journal sync doesn't depend on that session. |
| Live interop test | — | Partial | `LiveBlueskyInteropTest` runs only on request, and stops before the client metadata fetch. | Once staging serves client metadata, run a full sign-in against `bsky.social` from staging. |

### Top five gaps for Direction B

1. The server doesn't use the OAuth client: no client metadata, no routes, no stores.
2. No account kind for an identity hosted elsewhere.
3. No linking flow, and no decision on re-sealing the personal space when a DID changes.
4. No public-record writer that targets the person's own PDS.
5. No passkey creation step for people who arrive through an external sign-in.

## Cutover-freeze checklist

Each item becomes permanent, or expensive to change, once the first identity or record goes public.
"Final today" means it can be published as it stands.

| Item | Final today? | What it is now | What must be decided or fixed first |
|---|---|---|---|
| Publication model | No | Bulk publishing of every account, and automatic publishing of new identities when publishing is on. | Per-person opt-in only, as in Direction A. Decide what the Publish screen says, and require a registered recovery key first. |
| What a published identity's history shows | No | The PLC directory stores every operation permanently, including genesis. Existing accounts' genesis operations name the handle and PDS address they had when they were created. | Review each identity's full operation chain before publishing it. The rehearsal's wrong-address case shows a mistake can be corrected but not removed. |
| PDS address in DID documents | No | `https://cloud.logdate.app` (production `ATPROTO_PDS_SERVICE_URL`). The OAuth issuer is the same origin, inside relying party `logdate.app`. | Confirm this is the long-term host. Moving later needs a PLC operation for every published identity and ends every OAuth session, because issuers are compared exactly. |
| Server rotation key | No | The account's repository signing key also acts as the server's rotation key. | Use a separate rotation key in Cloud KMS before the first publication. |
| Rotation key order | Yes | `[recoveryKey, serverKey]`, with the person's key first. Recovery keys are P-256 and come from the recovery phrase. | — |
| Signing key algorithm | Yes | K-256 by default (`SigningKeyService`). P-256 is accepted and verified by the reference implementation. | None. Either can be rotated later with a PLC operation. |
| Handle domain | Mostly | `name.logdate.app` in production and `name.cloud-staging.logdate.app` in staging, with reserved labels shared with the website. | Confirm `logdate.app` is the permanent handle domain. Resolve handles only for published identities. Published handles appear in other apps' caches and links. |
| Server DID | No | `did:web:logdate.app`, which doesn't resolve. | Serve its document, or switch to `did:web:cloud.logdate.app`. |
| First public LogDate lexicons | No | `published.json` is empty. The public set is `app.logdate.actor.profile` and `app.logdate.crypto.keyDeclaration`. The key declaration's signature construction is still undecided in its schema. | Finalize those two schemas, list them in `published.json` so the lint refuses breaking changes, and publish them. Everything else under `app.logdate.*` stays private and unpublished. |
| Standard.site lexicons | Yes | `site.standard.publication` and `site.standard.document`, bundled from upstream. | None. This is why Direction B can publish first. |
| Legacy `studio.hypertext.logdate.*` | Yes, as never public | `PublicRepoPolicy` never shows them. A repository holding any private record isn't shown. | Publish an identity only after its legacy records are gone and its public repository has been recreated (step 6 of the personal space migration). |
| Sealed-storage names | Effectively yes | `app.logdate.crypto.sealed` and `app.logdate.space.personal` are part of the authenticated data of every sealed record in production. | Treat them as frozen. Renaming means re-sealing every record on devices. |
| `_lexicon` DNS authority | No | Not set up. NSID `app.logdate.actor.profile` has authority `actor.logdate.app`, so its record is a TXT at `_lexicon.actor.logdate.app`, and so on for each group. | Choose the account that publishes LogDate's `com.atproto.lexicon.schema` records, publish that identity first, and add one TXT record per group. |
| Permission set names | No | `app.logdate.authFull` and `app.logdate.authShare` are drafts. | Name the sets other apps will ask for, including one for Direction B's publishing, before any app depends on them. |
| Record keys | Partly | The profile is `self`. Key declarations, publications and documents use `tid`. The server makes TIDs with clock ID 0 every time (`LogDateRepoStore.kt`). The library's default key, when none is given, is `record-<seconds>`, which isn't a TID (`DefaultRepoEngine.kt`). | Use a random clock ID per process, and make the library default a TID. |
| Repository revisions | Yes | TIDs that increase with each commit, verified by the reference implementation. | — |
| Blob CIDs | Yes, as a format | CIDv1, raw codec, SHA-256. | Strip location metadata from images before upload. Once a blob is copied by an AppView, its bytes can't be taken back. |
| Personal space owner when a DID changes | No | Fixed by the sealed authenticated data. | Decide between re-sealing and keeping an internal owner (Direction B). |
| LogDate's OAuth client ID | No | Doesn't exist. | Choose a permanent `https` URL, such as `https://cloud.logdate.app/oauth/client-metadata.json`. Authorization servers bind sessions to it, so changing it later signs everyone out. |

## Recommended order

Each phase can start as soon as the one before it, or the named decision, is done. Nothing
irreversible happens before the freeze checklist passes, except that in Phase 2 a person publishes
Standard.site records to their own existing identity, deliberately.

### Phase 0: decisions (no code)

1. Opt-in publication: confirm the per-person model and retire bulk publishing.
2. The PDS address (`cloud.logdate.app` or another host) and the handle domain.
3. A separate server rotation key in Cloud KMS.
4. The personal space owner after linking: re-seal, or use the hosted DID as an internal owner.
5. LogDate's OAuth client ID URL.
6. Whether to offer app passwords for the official Bluesky app, or wait for Bluesky.

### Phase 1: Direction B on staging, with nothing published by LogDate

1. Wire `atproto-oauth-client` into the server, with client metadata, PostgreSQL stores and the
   shared lock.
2. Add the external identity kind and the linking flow behind a flag. Include the passkey step for
   new accounts and the re-seal or owner decision from Phase 0.
3. Add the public-record writer and outbound-write audit, publishing only Standard.site records.

### Phase 2: Direction B for the owner

Link `williecubed.me` on production behind the flag and publish one story as a `site.standard.document`
to it. This writes to an identity that is already public, using a schema LogDate doesn't own, so it
freezes nothing of LogDate's.

### Phase 3: Direction A server work, tested on staging

These change no published state and can run in parallel with Phases 1 and 2:

1. Shared DPoP nonces, `WWW-Authenticate`, and open CORS.
2. `getSession` for OAuth tokens, open collections for personal-space accounts, uploads,
   `applyWrites` and data-model validation.
3. `getServiceAuth`, service proxying with label headers, and preferences.
4. `transition:email`, `transition:chat.bsky`, and then fine-grained permissions.
5. The interop vectors in CI, an end-to-end test with the reference `@atproto/oauth-client`, and a
   local relay following staging's event stream.

To try Direction A with real apps before anything goes to the PLC directory, staging can give its
test accounts `did:web` identities (`ATPROTO_HOSTED_DID_METHOD=web`). A `did:web` resolves from the
handle's own host and isn't written to any permanent public log. Staging accounts on
`cloud-staging.logdate.app` could then sign in to Leaflet or Blacksky and be followed by a local
relay. First confirm that the website serves `/.well-known/did.json` for staging handle hosts. Use
this only for throwaway staging accounts, because a `did:web` identity can never move to another
host.

### Phase 4: the freeze

Close every "No" in the checklist:

- the separate rotation key;
- opt-in publication;
- handle resolution only for published identities;
- the server DID;
- the two public LogDate lexicons, `published.json` and `_lexicon` DNS;
- TID clock IDs;
- operation chain review.

Then rerun the rehearsal and the [identity publishing runbook](../../runbook/identity-publishing.md)
safeguards on the deployed commit.

### Phase 5: first publication

1. Publish a dedicated canary account by opt-in, with `ATPROTO_FIREHOSE_ENABLED`,
   `ATPROTO_RELAY_HOSTS`, `LOGDATE_OAUTH_PASSKEY_SIGN_IN_ENABLED` and the handle monitor turned on in
   production.
2. Sign in with OAuth apps, and check that Bluesky's AppView shows the profile.
3. Then open the Publish action to everyone.

Account migration in and out comes after this. So does the official Bluesky app, unless Phase 0
chose app passwords.

## Found along the way

- `./run lint:lexicons` and `./run lint:conformance` call `pnpm` directly. They fail when the
  installed pnpm isn't the version the tool pins. `tools/atproto-repo-verify/install.sh` already
  handles that case.
- `server/src/main/kotlin/app/logdate/server/atproto/SyntheticCid.kt` is unused private code.
- `ApiTags.kt` still says there is no event stream.
