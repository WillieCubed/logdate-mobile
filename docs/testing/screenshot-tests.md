# Screenshot Testing Guide

Screenshot tests compare rendered Compose previews against baseline images to detect unintended visual changes. LogDate uses Google's Compose Preview Screenshot Testing plugin for automated visual regression testing.

## Overview

Screenshot testing captures the visual appearance of your Compose previews and compares them against baseline images. Any visual changes trigger test failures, helping catch unintended UI changes.

**Technology**: Google Compose Preview Screenshot Testing (com.android.compose.screenshot)
**Requirements**: Android Gradle Plugin 8.5.0+, Kotlin 1.9.20+
**Workflows**: Light/dark themes, multiple screen sizes

## Creating Screenshot Tests

### Basic Preview Test

Screenshot tests are Compose previews marked with `@PreviewTest` annotation. Place them in `src/screenshotTest/kotlin/`:

```kotlin
// app/android-main/src/screenshotTest/kotlin/app/logdate/screenshots/OnboardingScreenshots.kt
package app.logdate.screenshots

import androidx.compose.ui.tooling.preview.Preview
import androidx.compose.ui.tooling.preview.PreviewLightDark
import com.android.tools.screenshot.PreviewTest
import app.logdate.feature.onboarding.ui.OnboardingStartScreen
import app.logdate.ui.theme.LogDateTheme

@PreviewTest
@Preview(showBackground = true)
@Composable
fun OnboardingStart_Default() {
    LogDateTheme {
        OnboardingStartScreen(
            onNext = {},
            onStartFromBackup = {}
        )
    }
}
```

### Light and Dark Variants

Use `@PreviewLightDark` to test both themes automatically:

```kotlin
@PreviewTest
@PreviewLightDark
@Composable
fun EditorScreen_LightDark() {
    LogDateTheme {
        EditorScreenContent(
            state = EditorState.Editing(entry),
            onSave = {},
            onCancel = {}
        )
    }
}
```

This generates two baseline images: one for light theme, one for dark theme.

### Multiple Screen Sizes

Test across device sizes using `@Preview` parameters:

```kotlin
@PreviewTest
@Preview(name = "Phone", widthDp = 360, heightDp = 800)
@Composable
fun TimelineScreen_Phone() {
    LogDateTheme {
        TimelineScreenContent()
    }
}

@PreviewTest
@Preview(name = "Tablet", widthDp = 800, heightDp = 1200)
@Composable
fun TimelineScreen_Tablet() {
    LogDateTheme {
        TimelineScreenContent()
    }
}

@PreviewTest
@Preview(name = "Landscape", widthDp = 900, heightDp = 400)
@Composable
fun TimelineScreen_Landscape() {
    LogDateTheme {
        TimelineScreenContent()
    }
}
```

## Test Organization

Phone screenshot tests live in `app/android-main/src/screenshotTest/kotlin/app/logdate/screenshots/`:

```
common/                      preview matrices, device specs, ScreenshotTheme, shared fixtures
flows/flowNN_<area>/         user flows, one file per screen: FlowNN_MM_<Name>Screenshots.kt
  flow20_os_integration/     Android OS integration surfaces and the screens they open
components/<area>/           shared components
audit/adaptive/              foldable posture audits (book and tabletop)
audit/workspace/             Home workspace audits
```

Preview functions inside a flow file are numbered in display order (`S01_...`, `S02_...`).

### Preview matrices

Apply a matrix annotation instead of listing `@Preview`s by hand. They live in
`common/ScreenshotPreviewMatrix.kt`, and the device specs in `common/ScreenshotTestData.kt`.

| Annotation | Configurations | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@ScreenshotPreviewMatrix` | Phone, Phone Dark, Landscape, Tablet | Most screens |
| `@LargeScreenAuditPreviewMatrix` | Split Medium, Tablet Landscape, Tablet Portrait, Desktop Window | Large-screen regressions |
| `@OsIntegrationPreviewMatrix` | Phone, Phone Dark, Compact Phone, Landscape, Tablet, RTL, Large Text (200%), Dynamic Color | Every Android OS integration feature (required) |
| `@BubbleWindowPreview` | Bubble (360×480dp) | Added next to `@OsIntegrationPreviewMatrix` for screens that can open in an app bubble |

Wear tests in `app/wear/src/screenshotTest/` use `@WearScreenshotPreviewMatrix` (small round and
large round).

### Shared scenes

A screen that also renders on desktop should be a shared scene in `client/screenshot-scenes`. Define
it once, and render it from the Android preview with `SharedScreenshotScene(id)`; the desktop lane
renders every shared scene automatically. Each scene lists the viewports it must render in. OS
integration scenes use `osIntegrationVariants`, which adds a compact phone, right-to-left, and 200%
text to the standard viewports, or `osIntegrationBubbleVariants` for bubble-capable screens. See
[`client/screenshot-scenes/README.md`](../../client/screenshot-scenes/README.md).

## Android OS integration screenshots

Every feature in the Native Android integration program
([design](../feature-design/android-os-integration.md)) ships screenshots in the same commit as
its code. That includes the right-to-left, 200% text, compact, and dynamic color configurations
that CLAUDE.md requires for UI acceptance.

1. Put the scene in `flows/flow20_os_integration/`, with `@OsIntegrationPreviewMatrix` (plus
   `@BubbleWindowPreview` where it applies). If it renders on desktop too, make it a shared scene with
   `osIntegrationVariants`.
2. Record references:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew :app:android-main:updateDebugScreenshotTest --tests '*Flow20_*'
   ./gradlew :app:compose-main:updateDesktopScreenshotTest -Dlogdate.desktopScreenshots.sceneFilter=<scene-id>
   ```

3. Open every new or changed reference and check it against the intended behavior before committing.
   A render that succeeded is not the same as a render that is right.

4. Register every screenshot the feature needs in `config/screenshots/os-integration-coverage.txt`,
   then run the coverage check:

   ```bash
   ./run screenshots:check
   ```

The first OS integration scene is `S01_PrivacySystemSearchVisibility` in
`Flow20_01_SystemSearchVisibilityScreenshots.kt`. It shows the privacy setting that controls system
search and assistant access.

### Real system UI captures

Some OS integration surfaces are drawn by Android, not by LogDate: the launcher's shortcut popup, the
Quick Settings shade, notification chips, bubbles, and the lock screen. Compose screenshot tests cannot
see them, so `OsSurfaceScreenshotsTest` captures them on Gradle Managed Devices:

```bash
# Every capture, on the Android 17 phone and tablet
./run screenshots:os

# One capture on the Android 16 phone
OS_SURFACE_TEST=launcherShortcuts ./run screenshots:os flagshipPhoneApi36
```

The test drives Android with UI Automator, and pins the status bar with SystemUI demo mode. The clock
reads 9:41, the battery is full, and no notification icons show, so captures of one state stay
comparable. Text evidence, such as Android's verdict on a Live Update, is saved next to the images.
When a wait fails, the test saves what the screen showed (a screenshot and the view tree) under
`failures/` in the managed device output, which is never copied. Images are copied to
`docs/screenshots/android-os-integration/<surface>/<state>--<phone|tablet>-api<level>.png`. They are
reviewed evidence rather than pixel-compared goldens, because system UI changes slightly between
emulator images. Look at each one, then register it under the `system` lane.

### Comparison sheets

Reviewing a feature means comparing its screenshots side by side, not opening forty files one at a
time. The comparison sheet builder lays out every registered image for a feature on one labeled
image, scaled to the same height:

```bash
./run screenshots:sheet -Pfeature=privacy-system-search
```

Sheets are written to `build/reports/screenshot-sheets/<feature>.png`. Run it without `-Pfeature` to
get one sheet per feature. Generating and reviewing the sheet is part of every OS integration
feature's Definition of Done.

### The coverage registry

"Every feature ships screenshots" is only a promise until something checks it.
`config/screenshots/os-integration-coverage.txt` lists the screenshots each feature must have, one per
line as `feature|lane|target`:

```text
privacy-system-search|android|app/logdate/screenshots/flows/flow20_os_integration/Flow20_01_SystemSearchVisibilityScreenshots.kt#S01_PrivacySystemSearchVisibility
privacy-system-search|desktop|privacy-settings
quick-settings-tiles|system|docs/screenshots/android-os-integration/quick-settings-tiles/shade-active--phone-api37.png
```

| Lane | Target | What the check requires |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `android` | `File.kt#Function` under `app/android-main/src/screenshotTest/kotlin` | The function exists, uses `@OsIntegrationPreviewMatrix`, and has a reference for every configuration in it (plus Bubble when `@BubbleWindowPreview` is applied) |
| `desktop` | Shared scene id | References for `phone`, `phone-dark`, `compact-phone`, `phone-rtl`, and `phone-large-text` |
| `system` | Repository path | A real PNG captured from a managed device, or non-empty `.txt` evidence |
| `glance` | Repository path | A real PNG widget reference |

`checkOsIntegrationScreenshotCoverage` (`./run screenshots:check`) fails when:

- a registered screenshot is missing;
- a preview in `flows/flow20_os_integration/` uses the OS integration matrix but is not registered;
- any phone screenshot reference has no matching test.

That last rule keeps the reference set honest: when you rename or delete a preview, delete its
references in the same commit. The pre-push hook runs the check. The logic lives in
`build-logic/src/main/kotlin/app/logdate/ScreenshotCoverage.kt`, with tests in
`build-logic/src/test/kotlin/app/logdate/ScreenshotCoverageTest.kt`.

## Guidelines for Screenshot Tests

### What to Screenshot

Capture key user-facing screens and states:

```kotlin
// Onboarding journey
@PreviewTest @PreviewLightDark
fun OnboardingWelcome() { }

@PreviewTest @PreviewLightDark
fun OnboardingPermissions() { }

@PreviewTest @PreviewLightDark
fun OnboardingComplete() { }

// Core screens
@PreviewTest @PreviewLightDark
fun TimelineScreen() { }

@PreviewTest @PreviewLightDark
fun EditorEmpty() { }

@PreviewTest @PreviewLightDark
fun JournalDetail() { }

// Important states
@PreviewTest @PreviewLightDark
fun LoadingState() { }

@PreviewTest @PreviewLightDark
fun ErrorState() { }

@PreviewTest @PreviewLightDark
fun EmptyState() { }
```

### What NOT to Screenshot

Skip screenshots for:
- Low-level component variations (use UI tests instead)
- Implementation details
- Every single state combination (select important ones)
- Components that change frequently during development

## Running Screenshot Tests

Screenshot tests are host-side preview tests and do not use a connected Android device. For any Android runtime verification you do alongside screenshot work, target the emulator explicitly instead of relying on whichever device is attached:

```bash
export ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554
adb -s emulator-5554 devices
```

### Generate Baseline Images

Create or update reference images for the first time or after intentional changes. `./run
test:screenshots:update` updates every lane at once. Updating rewrites every reference in a lane,
including ones your change did not touch, so prefer updating only your own tests with `--tests`
(for example `--tests '*HomeWorkspaceScreenshotsKt.Workspace*InDesktopWindow*'`) and review what
changed before committing:

```bash
# Update baselines — phone app
./gradlew :app:android-main:updateDebugScreenshotTest

# Update baselines — Wear OS app
./gradlew :app:wear:updateDebugScreenshotTest

# Update baselines — Desktop app
./gradlew :app:compose-main:updateDesktopScreenshotTest
```

Phone baselines: `app/android-main/src/screenshotTestDebug/reference/`
Wear baselines: `app/wear/src/screenshotTestDebug/reference/`
Desktop baselines: `app/compose-main/src/desktopTest/reference/`

**In CI/CD**: Commit baseline images to version control alongside your code.

### Validate Against Baselines

Check if current screenshots match baselines. `./run test:screenshots` validates every lane, and
keeps going past a failing lane so each one reports:

```bash
# Validate — phone app
./gradlew :app:android-main:validateDebugScreenshotTest

# Validate — Wear OS app
./gradlew :app:wear:validateDebugScreenshotTest

# Validate — Desktop app
./gradlew :app:compose-main:validateDesktopScreenshotTest
```

**In CI/CD**: This command runs automatically on pull requests.

### Review Failed Screenshots

When validation fails, check the diff:

```bash
open app/android-main/build/outputs/screenshotTest-results/preview/debug/
```

Inspect:
- `rendered/` - Current screenshots
- `reference/` - Baseline screenshots
- `diffs/` - Difference highlights (if generated)

## Workflow Example

### Initial Setup

1. Write your Compose screen:
   ```kotlin
   @Composable
   fun MyNewScreen() { }
   ```

2. Create screenshot test:
   ```kotlin
   @PreviewTest
   @PreviewLightDark
   fun MyNewScreen_LightDark() {
       LogDateTheme {
           MyNewScreen()
       }
   }
   ```

3. Generate baseline:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :app:android-main:updateDebugScreenshotTest
   ```

4. Commit baseline image to git:
   ```bash
   git add app/android-main/src/screenshotTestDebug/reference/
   ```

### During Development

1. Make UI changes

2. Run validation to check impact:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :app:android-main:validateDebugScreenshotTest
   ```

3. If changes are intentional, update baseline:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :app:android-main:updateDebugScreenshotTest
   ```

4. Review and commit the new baseline

### Code Review

1. Pull request includes UI changes
2. CI runs screenshot validation
3. Reviewer sees generated diff
4. If approved, baseline update is part of commit

## Managing Baseline Images

### Storing Baselines

Baseline images live in version control:
```
app/android-main/src/screenshotTestDebug/reference/
├── app/logdate/screenshots/
│   ├── EditorScreenKt/
│   │   ├── EditorEmpty_light.png
│   │   └── EditorEmpty_dark.png
│   └── TimelineScreenKt/
│       ├── Timeline_light.png
│       └── Timeline_dark.png
```

### Updating Baselines

When a screenshot fails but changes are intentional:

```bash
# Update specific screenshot
./gradlew :app:android-main:updateDebugScreenshotTest

# Commit the new baseline
git add app/android-main/src/screenshotTestDebug/reference/
git commit -m "refactor(ui): update screenshots for new design"
```

### Removing Baselines

When deleting screenshot tests:

```bash
# Remove the @PreviewTest function
# Remove the reference image
git rm app/android-main/src/screenshotTestDebug/reference/path/to/image.png
```

## Advanced Testing

### Testing Complex States

```kotlin
@PreviewTest
@PreviewLightDark
fun EditorWithSuggestionsExpanded() {
    LogDateTheme {
        EditorScreenContent(
            state = EditorState.Editing(
                entry = testEntry(),
                suggestionsVisible = true,
                suggestions = listOf("suggestion1", "suggestion2")
            ),
            onSave = {},
            onCancel = {}
        )
    }
}

@PreviewTest
@PreviewLightDark
fun TimelineWithLoadingError() {
    LogDateTheme {
        TimelineScreenContent(
            state = TimelineState.Error(
                message = "Failed to load entries",
                retryAvailable = true
            ),
            onRetry = {}
        )
    }
}
```

### Testing Different Data

```kotlin
@PreviewTest
@PreviewLightDark
fun JournalDetailWithManyEntries() {
    LogDateTheme {
        JournalDetail(
            journal = testJournal().copy(
                entries = (1..20).map { testEntry(content = "Entry $it") }
            )
        )
    }
}

@PreviewTest
@PreviewLightDark
fun JournalDetailEmpty() {
    LogDateTheme {
        JournalDetail(
            journal = testJournal().copy(entries = emptyList())
        )
    }
}
```

## Wear OS screenshots

Wear OS screenshot tests render on round watch displays instead of rectangular phone screens.
A custom multi-preview annotation targets both supported form factors:

```kotlin
// app/wear/src/screenshotTest/.../WearScreenshotPreviewMatrix.kt
@Preview(name = "Small Round", device = "id:wearos_small_round", showBackground = true)
@Preview(name = "Large Round", device = "id:wearos_large_round", showBackground = true)
annotation class WearScreenshotPreviewMatrix
```

Use `@WearScreenshotPreviewMatrix` instead of `@PreviewLightDark` for Wear OS screens:

```kotlin
@PreviewTest
@WearScreenshotPreviewMatrix
@Composable
fun S01_WalkieTalkieReady() {
    MaterialTheme {
        ReadyContent(onTouchDown = {}, onTouchUp = {})
    }
}
```

Each preview generates two baselines (small round + large round). Wrap content in Wear
`MaterialTheme` (not phone `LogDateTheme`).

```bash
# Generate Wear OS baselines
./gradlew :app:wear:updateDebugScreenshotTest

# Validate Wear OS screenshots
./gradlew :app:wear:validateDebugScreenshotTest
```

## KMP considerations

Google Compose Screenshot Testing works with Android targets only. LogDate now wraps that limitation in a repo-level universal screenshot lane:

1. **Android and Wear**: real baseline screenshot validation via `com.android.compose.screenshot`
2. **Desktop**: real committed baseline validation via `:app:compose-main:validateDesktopScreenshotTest`
3. **iOS**: simulator-side `iosSimulatorArm64Test` validation for screenshot-covered UI modules

Use the root tasks when you want the platform-agnostic entrypoint:

```bash
# Validate the full universal screenshot lane
./gradlew validateAllScreenshots

# Update every supported baseline lane
./gradlew updateAllScreenshots

# Per-platform entrypoints
./gradlew validateAndroidScreenshots
./gradlew validateDesktopScreenshots
./gradlew validateIosScreenshots
```

Desktop now participates as a real baseline lane. `updateAllScreenshots` updates Android, Wear, and Desktop baselines. iOS remains validate-only until a committed iOS screenshot baseline renderer lands.

```kotlin
// This only runs on Android
@PreviewTest
@PreviewLightDark
fun ComposablePreview() {
    // Android screenshot test
}
```

## CI/CD Integration

`.github/workflows/screenshot-test.yml` validates screenshots on pushes to `main`, and on pull requests
that touch app, feature, UI, theme, or build code. It runs three jobs:

| Job | Runner | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `android-wear-screenshots` | macOS with JetBrains JDK 21 (phone and Wear, matching the committed references' rendering host) | `./gradlew :app:<module>:validateDebugScreenshotTest --continue` |
| `desktop-screenshots` | macOS | `./gradlew validateDesktopScreenshots --continue` |
| `ios-screenshot-validation` | macOS | `./gradlew validateIosScreenshots --continue` |

Android rendering results, XML, and HTML diagnostics upload even when validation fails; the runner change does not relax image thresholds or regenerate baselines. Each job uploads its results (rendered images and diffs) as a build artifact. When a job fails,
download the artifact and compare the `diffs/` images with the references.

Android and Wear validation use `TZ=America/Los_Angeles` and
`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Duser.timezone=America/Los_Angeles`, matching the committed references' local
date/time labels. Use the same environment when validating or recording their references locally.
The validation step has a 40-minute timeout inside a 45-minute job, leaving time to upload rendered
images, diffs, and XML/HTML reports even when validation times out.

## Troubleshooting

### "Expected images not found"

Baseline images missing. Generate them:
```bash
# Phone
./gradlew :app:android-main:updateDebugScreenshotTest
git add app/android-main/src/screenshotTestDebug/reference/

# Wear OS
./gradlew :app:wear:updateDebugScreenshotTest
git add app/wear/src/screenshotTestDebug/reference/

# Desktop
./gradlew :app:compose-main:updateDesktopScreenshotTest
git add app/compose-main/src/desktopTest/reference/
```

### "Images do not match"

Visual changes detected. Options:

1. If changes are unintended: Fix the UI code
2. If changes are intentional: Update baseline
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :app:android-main:updateDebugScreenshotTest  # phone
   ./gradlew :app:wear:updateDebugScreenshotTest           # wear
   ./gradlew :app:compose-main:updateDesktopScreenshotTest # desktop
   ```

### Screenshot filename confusion

Filenames are auto-generated from:
- Package: `app.logdate.screenshots`
- Class: `EditorScreenshotsKt`
- Function: `EditorEmpty`
- Theme: `_light.png` or `_dark.png`

Example:
```
app/logdate/screenshots/EditorScreenshotsKt/EditorEmpty_light.png
app/logdate/screenshots/EditorScreenshotsKt/EditorEmpty_dark.png
```

## Best Practices

1. **Screenshot Critical Journeys Only**: Focus on key screens
2. **Use Light/Dark Variants**: Always test both themes
3. **Keep Baselines in Git**: Version control your visual expectations
4. **Review Diffs in PR**: Let reviewers see what changed
5. **Document State**: Include comments for non-obvious test setup
6. **Update Regularly**: Keep baselines current during development
7. **Combine with UI Tests**: Screenshots for appearance, UI tests for behavior

## Desktop Screenshot Operations

Desktop screenshot validation for `app/compose-main` runs through the normal desktop unit test task and does not require any Android device, emulator, `adb`, or connected-device task.

Core tasks:

```bash
# Validate committed desktop baselines
./gradlew :app:compose-main:desktopTest \
  --tests 'app.logdate.screenshots.DesktopScreenshotTest.shared_catalog_matches_baselines'

# Convenience alias for the same validation lane
./gradlew :app:compose-main:validateDesktopScreenshotTest

# Refresh committed desktop baselines
./gradlew :app:compose-main:updateDesktopScreenshotTest
```

Default behavior:

- Desktop screenshot tests now run in hidden mode by default.
- The harness creates a displayable off-screen surface without forcing a visible foreground window.
- Hidden mode avoids stealing focus from the current desktop window.
- Hidden mode also avoids hover and focus contamination from the mouse pointer during screenshot capture.

Visible mode:

Use visible mode only when you explicitly want to watch screenshots render live on the desktop.

```bash
./gradlew -Dlogdate.desktopScreenshots.visible=true \
  :app:compose-main:desktopTest \
  --tests 'app.logdate.screenshots.DesktopScreenshotTest.shared_catalog_matches_baselines'
```

Scene filtering:

Use `logdate.desktopScreenshots.sceneFilter` to run only a subset of the shared screenshot catalog. The filter matches `SharedScreenshotSceneId.value` substrings.

```bash
# Run only onboarding-start scenes
./gradlew -Dlogdate.desktopScreenshots.sceneFilter=onboarding-start \
  :app:compose-main:desktopTest \
  --tests 'app.logdate.screenshots.DesktopScreenshotTest.shared_catalog_matches_baselines'

# Run only settings scenes and show them live
./gradlew \
  -Dlogdate.desktopScreenshots.visible=true \
  -Dlogdate.desktopScreenshots.sceneFilter=settings \
  :app:compose-main:desktopTest \
  --tests 'app.logdate.screenshots.DesktopScreenshotTest.shared_catalog_matches_baselines'
```

Desktop baseline locations:

- References: `app/compose-main/src/desktopTest/reference`
- Actual renders: `app/compose-main/build/reports/desktopScreenshotTest/actual`
- Pixel diffs: `app/compose-main/build/reports/desktopScreenshotTest/diff`

Recommended workflow for desktop screenshot changes:

1. Narrow the scope with `logdate.desktopScreenshots.sceneFilter` while iterating on a scene.
2. Run hidden mode by default to avoid desktop interference.
3. Use visible mode only when you need to inspect transitions or layout behavior live.
4. Refresh baselines with `:app:compose-main:updateDesktopScreenshotTest` after the render path is deterministic.
5. Re-run `:app:compose-main:desktopTest --tests 'app.logdate.screenshots.DesktopScreenshotTest.shared_catalog_matches_baselines'` before committing.

## Native backup settings fixtures

The shared catalog includes signed-out, signed-in and native-quota states in
`NativeBackupScreenshotScenes.kt`. Each explicitly enables Android coverage rows
and uses the OS integration viewport matrix. Follow the scoped commands and review
criteria in [Settings UI composition](../reference/standards/settings-ui.md).
