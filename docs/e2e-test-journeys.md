# End-to-End Test Journeys for LogDate

This document outlines the key user journeys that should be covered by end-to-end instrumented tests for the LogDate application.

## Navigation Architecture Overview

LogDate uses a hierarchical navigation structure with the following key components:

- **BaseRoute**: Entry point and initialization
- **Onboarding Flow**: First-time user setup 
- **Home**: Main app dashboard with timeline and journals
- **Editor**: Note creation and editing
- **Journals**: Journal management and viewing
- **Settings**: App configuration
- **Rewind**: Historical content review

## Primary User Journeys

**Test Verification Points**:
- [ ] App initializes without crashes
- [ ] Onboarding screens display correctly
- [ ] User can progress through onboarding steps
- [ ] Onboarding completion navigates to Home
- [ ] App state indicates onboarding is complete

**Edge Cases**:

- Onboarding skip/cancel scenarios

### 2. Note Creation Journey

**Scenario**: User creates their first note

**Critical Path**:
1. Start from Home screen
2. Tap "Create Note" action
3. Navigate to Editor (NewNoteRoute)
4. Enter text content
5. Save note
6. Navigate back to Home
7. Verify note appears in timeline

**Test Verification Points**:
- [ ] Editor opens correctly from Home
- [ ] Text input works properly
- [ ] Save functionality persists data
- [ ] Navigation back to Home works
- [ ] Created note displays in timeline
- [ ] Note data persists across app restarts

**Variations**:
- Text-only notes
- Notes with image attachments
- Notes with multiple media types
- Draft auto-save functionality

### 3. Journal Management Journey

**Scenario**: User creates and manages journals

**Critical Path**:
1. From Home, navigate to Journals overview
2. Create new journal
3. Configure journal settings (title, description)
4. Save journal
5. Add notes to journal
6. View journal contents
7. Navigate between journals

**Test Verification Points**:
- [ ] Journal creation flow works
- [ ] Journal appears in journals list
- [ ] Notes can be associated with journals
- [ ] Journal detail view shows correct content
- [ ] Journal settings can be modified
- [ ] Journal deletion works correctly

### 4. Timeline Navigation Journey

**Scenario**: User browses their timeline and accesses content

**Critical Path**:
1. Start from Home (timeline view)
2. Browse timeline entries
3. Select a timeline item
4. View item details
5. Navigate back to timeline
6. Perform timeline actions (delete, share)

**Test Verification Points**:
- [ ] Timeline loads and displays entries
- [ ] Timeline item selection works
- [ ] Detail view shows correct content
- [ ] Back navigation preserves timeline state
- [ ] Timeline actions function correctly
- [ ] Timeline updates reflect data changes

### 5. Settings Configuration Journey

**Scenario**: User accesses and modifies app settings

**Critical Path**:
1. Navigate to Settings from Home
2. Browse settings categories
3. Modify preferences
4. Save changes
5. Navigate back to Home
6. Verify settings are applied

**Test Verification Points**:
- [ ] Settings screen loads correctly
- [ ] All settings options are accessible
- [ ] Setting changes persist
- [ ] Settings affect app behavior
- [ ] Navigation back maintains changes

## Secondary User Journeys

### 6. Cross-Feature Integration Journey

**Scenario**: User performs actions across multiple features

**Critical Path**:
1. Create note in Editor
2. Navigate to Journals
3. Create new journal
4. Associate note with journal
5. View note in journal context
6. Access note from timeline
7. Edit note from journal view

**Test Verification Points**:
- [ ] Data consistency across features
- [ ] Navigation preserves context
- [ ] Cross-feature associations work
- [ ] UI state updates correctly

### 7. Data Persistence Journey

**Scenario**: Verify data survives app lifecycle events

**Critical Path**:
1. Create content (notes, journals)
2. Navigate between screens
3. Force app background/foreground
4. Kill and restart app
5. Verify all data is preserved
6. Verify app state is restored

**Test Verification Points**:
- [ ] Data persists across app restarts
- [ ] Navigation state is restored appropriately
- [ ] No data loss during lifecycle events
- [ ] Background/foreground transitions work

### 8. Error Handling Journey

**Scenario**: App gracefully handles error conditions

**Critical Path**:
1. Trigger error conditions (network issues, storage full)
2. Verify user-friendly error messages
3. Test recovery mechanisms
4. Ensure app remains functional

**Test Verification Points**:
- [ ] Error messages are displayed appropriately
- [ ] App doesn't crash on errors
- [ ] User can recover from error states
- [ ] Data integrity is maintained

## Edge Cases & Stress Tests

### 9. Large Data Set Journey

**Scenario**: App performance with substantial content

**Test Conditions**:
- Create 100+ notes
- Create 10+ journals
- Generate extensive timeline
- Test search and filtering

### 10. Rapid Navigation Journey

**Scenario**: Quick navigation between screens

**Test Conditions**:
- Rapidly navigate between all major screens
- Test back button behavior
- Verify no memory leaks
- Ensure UI responsiveness

### 11. Concurrent Operations Journey

**Scenario**: Multiple operations happening simultaneously

**Test Conditions**:
- Create note while syncing
- Navigate during data operations
- Handle interruptions gracefully

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Screen Object Pattern
Each major screen should have a corresponding test object:
- `HomeScreenRobot`
- `EditorScreenRobot`
- `JournalsScreenRobot`
- `SettingsScreenRobot`
- `OnboardingScreenRobot`

### Test Data Management
- Use predictable test data
- Clean up after each test
- Use in-memory database for testing
- Mock external dependencies

### Verification Strategies
- UI state verification
- Database state verification
- Navigation state verification
- Cross-screen data consistency checks

## Testing Tools & Framework

- **Compose UI Testing**: For UI interactions
- **Navigation Testing**: For route verification
- **Room Testing**: For database operations
- **Koin Testing**: For dependency injection
- **Coroutines Testing**: For async operations

This journey documentation provides the foundation for implementing comprehensive end-to-end tests that ensure LogDate functions correctly across all user workflows.
