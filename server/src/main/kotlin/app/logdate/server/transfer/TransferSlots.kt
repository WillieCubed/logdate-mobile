/**
 * How many file transfers one server instance runs at once, and how long a transfer may wait for its
 * client before giving up its slot.
 *
 * The caps come from the memory budget of the smallest deployed instance: 512 MiB with a heap of 75%,
 * about 384 MiB, leaving about 128 MiB for everything outside the heap, including `/tmp`, which Cloud
 * Run keeps in memory.
 *
 * - A streamed upload goes from the request straight to object storage. It holds one Cloud Storage
 *   write buffer (2 MiB) and one read chunk (64 KiB) in the heap, and nothing in `/tmp`. Eight of them
 *   take about 17 MiB, under 5% of the heap.
 * - A download streams from object storage through one Cloud Storage read buffer (2 MiB) and one
 *   chunk (64 KiB). Sixteen of them take about 33 MiB, under 10% of the heap.
 * - A buffered transfer, such as a backup, still goes through files in `/tmp` and can hold far more
 *   than the memory outside the heap, so only one runs at a time.
 *
 * Together the streamed caps stay near 50 MiB, leaving most of the heap for the other requests an
 * instance serves at once.
 *
 * @property streamedUploads uploads written straight to object storage.
 * @property downloads downloads read straight from object storage.
 * @property bufferedTransfers uploads and downloads that pass through temporary files.
 * @property idleTimeout how long a transfer waits for its client to send or accept more bytes.
 * @property retryAfterSeconds the `Retry-After` given with a refused transfer.
