 * Per-key rate limiter that counts requests in fixed windows of [RateLimitPolicy.windowSeconds],
 * each starting at a key's first request after the last one ended. Each key costs one small counter
 * however high its budget, and windows that have ended are swept away every [SWEEP_EVERY_CALLS]
 * calls, so memory follows the number of recently active keys rather than the requests they made.
 *
 * A caller can spend a whole budget at the end of one window and again at the start of the next, so
 * a burst can reach twice [RateLimitPolicy.maxRequests]; budgets meant to stop runaway clients, not
 * to meter exactly, can afford that. Counts live in this instance's memory.
