 * collections: a record in any other collection is reported as missing and a listing of one is
 * empty, so a caller cannot tell a private collection from one that does not exist.
 *
 * Anything that reveals the repository itself needs more: the record tree must hold nothing
 * private. That covers the export, and also the head, the revision and the listing, because a tree
 * names every record's collection and key, and a revision is the time of a write. An account that
 * moved into its personal space keeps its old journal records in the tree for a while, and until they
 * are erased none of this is shown.
 *
 * Reads go straight to the block store through a read-only engine. They never pass through the
 * adapters that present a person's journal as records, so no private record can be reached from here.
