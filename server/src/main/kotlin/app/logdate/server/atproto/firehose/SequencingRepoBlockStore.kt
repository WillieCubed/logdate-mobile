/**
 * Passes every call to [delegate] and reports each commit it stores to [sequencer].
 *
 * Every writer of the repository goes through one block store, so a commit made by the sync
 * routes, by `com.atproto.repo.createRecord` or by a background job reaches the event log the
 * same way, and nothing needs to remember to announce a write. The engine records a commit after it
 * has moved the repository's head, so the sequencer finds the head already pointing at it.
 *
 * Failing to announce never fails the write that triggered it: the records are saved, and the next
 * commit finds that its predecessor was never announced and announces the repository's state
 * instead. The failure is logged.
