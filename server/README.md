# `:server`

**Self-hostable backend API and services using Ktor**

## Overview

Ktor-based server providing API endpoints, data synchronization services, and backend functionality for the LogDate application. Designed to be easily containerizable and self-hostable, allowing users to run their own instance of LogDate Cloud with full data ownership and privacy control.

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Self-hostable**: Complete Docker containerization for easy deployment
- **Privacy-first**: Users maintain full control over their data
- **Cloud-optional**: Can run entirely offline or with minimal cloud dependencies
- **Configuration-driven**: Flexible configuration for different deployment scenarios

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all server tests
./gradlew :server:test

# Run specific test classes
./gradlew :server:test --tests "app.logdate.server.passkeys.*"
./gradlew :server:test --tests "app.logdate.server.routes.*"
./gradlew :server:test --tests "app.logdate.server.auth.*"

# Run individual test
./gradlew :server:test --tests "app.logdate.server.passkeys.PasskeyServiceTest.generateRegistrationOptions creates valid options"

# Test compilation only (useful when main code has issues)
./gradlew :server:compileTestKotlin
```

### Available Test Suites
