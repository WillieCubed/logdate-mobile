# Editor Tests

This directory contains tests for the editor UI components and functionality.

## Test Files

- **AutoSaveHandlerTest**: Tests for the autosave functionality, including debouncing, content change detection, and error handling.
- **EditorStateTest**: Tests for the editor state management, including state copying, read-only blocks, and content validation.
- **TextEditingTest**: Tests for text editing functionality, including block creation, updates, and autosave triggering.
- **TextBlockContentTest**: UI tests for the text block component, including text input, placeholders, and read-only state.

Together, these tests ensure that text editing properly updates state and triggers autosave functionality as expected.
