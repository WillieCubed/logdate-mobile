/**
 * UI state surface for the event detail / edit screen.
 *
 * The screen always sits in exactly one of three states. The transition diagram is:
 *
 * ```
 * Loading ──► Loaded   (event resolved from the repository)
 * Loading ──► NotFound (no event with the requested id, or it was soft-deleted)
 * Loaded  ──► NotFound (the event is deleted while the screen is open)
 * ```
 *
 * The [Loaded] state holds the *draft* event being edited, which differs from the persisted
 * event until [EventDetailViewModel.save] is called. Picker visibility flags are part of the
 * state so configuration changes (rotation, theme switch, screen unlock) don't dismiss them.

/**
 * ViewModel powering the event detail / edit screen.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *
 * 1. Resolve an event by id and expose it as [uiState] for the screen to render.
 * 2. Observe the linked notes and the user's saved places, combining everything into one
 *    [EventDetailUiState.Loaded] without torn intermediate states.
 * 3. Hold the in-progress edit draft separately from the persisted event so the user can type,
 *    pick a new time, swap places, etc., and only commit on Save.
 * 4. Lazily fetch candidate notes for the attach sheet when the user opens it, scoped to the
 *    current draft's time window.
 * 5. Mediate Save and Delete through domain use cases, surfacing success/failure as state.
 *
 * Implements [EventDetailActions] directly so the screen can pass the ViewModel instance as
 * its actions slot — this is the Android architecture guide's recommended state+actions
 * pattern and keeps lambda identity stable across recompositions without manual `remember`.
 *
 * Per project rules: no repository calls; everything goes through use cases.
 *
 * **Save semantics:**
 * - Title, description, time bounds, place, and cover image are *staged* in the loaded state
 *   and only persisted when [save] is called. Discarding the screen drops them.
 * - **Linking and unlinking notes is persisted immediately**, on the theory that the user
 *   expects an "Attach" tap to stick the moment they tap it (otherwise the attach sheet would
 *   need its own commit/cancel, which is a worse UX). The `linkedNotes` flow updates from
 *   upstream so the change is visible right after the use case returns.
 *
 * @param getEventById Reactive lookup that emits the latest copy of an event by id, or `null`
 *   when the event does not exist or has been soft-deleted.
 * @param observeLinkedNotesForEvent Reactive lookup that resolves the linked-note junction
 *   into full [JournalNote] objects for the event detail's "Attached" section.
 * @param getAttachableNotesForEvent One-shot fetch of candidate notes near the event in time,
 *   triggered when the user opens the attach sheet.
 * @param observeUserPlaces Reactive lookup of the user's saved places for the place picker.
 * @param updateEvent Persists edits to an event's mutable metadata.
 * @param deleteEvent Soft-deletes the event so it disappears from the timeline and detail view.
 * @param linkNoteToEvent Persists a new note attachment immediately.
 * @param unlinkNoteFromEvent Persists a note detachment immediately.
