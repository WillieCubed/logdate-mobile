/**
 * Sealed interface defining all possible UI states for the Rewind overview screen.
 * 
 * This state hierarchy manages the different phases of rewind data availability,
 * ensuring the UI can gracefully handle loading, partial data, and complete data
 * scenarios while maintaining the "always show content" design principle.
 * 
 * ## State Progression:
 * The typical state flow is: Loading → NotReady → Ready
 * However, direct Loading → Ready transitions are possible when current week
 * rewinds are immediately available.
 * 
 * ## Design Philosophy:
 * Each state ensures users always see meaningful content rather than empty states.
 * Even Loading shows placeholder cards to maintain the floating card design.
 * 
 * ## Architecture Benefits:
 * - **Type Safety**: Compiler ensures all states are handled
 * - **Predictable UI**: Each state has clear presentation requirements
 * - **Future-Proof**: New states can be added without breaking existing code

     * The UI state when rewind data is being fetched from the backend.

     * This initial state occurs when the screen first loads and no rewind data
     * is available yet. The UI shows placeholder cards to maintain the floating
     * card design even during loading.
     * 
     * ## UI Behavior:
     * - Shows "Loading..." placeholder card for current week
     * - Maintains floating card layout structure
     * - No past rewinds are shown until data arrives
     * 
     * ## Duration:

    /**
     * The UI state when past rewinds are available but the current week's rewind is not ready.
     * 
     * This is the most common steady state, as current week rewinds require ongoing
     * processing and are typically not available until the week is complete or
     * significant activity has occurred.
     * 
     * ## UI Behavior:
     * - Shows "Coming Soon" placeholder card for current week with muted styling
     * - Displays all available past rewinds as interactive cards
     * - Maintains the same floating card layout and interactions
     * 
     * ## User Communication:
     * The placeholder card clearly indicates that the current week's rewind is
     * "Still working on this week's rewind..." to set proper expectations.
     * 
     * ## Transition Conditions:
     * Moves to Ready when current week processing completes, typically:
     * - At end of week (Sunday night)
     * - When sufficient activity data exists
     * - When user manually triggers rewind generation

/**
 * UI state representing a single rewind for display in the floating card interface.
 * 
 * This rich data class contains all the information needed to render a rewind card,
 * including content, metadata, and availability status. It serves as the bridge
 * between domain data and UI presentation.
 * 
 * ## Content Structure:
 * - **Header**: Label and title for quick identification
 * - **Message**: AI-generated descriptive text about the week's highlights
 * - **Dates**: Clear start/end date range for temporal context
 * - **Activities**: Future expansion for rich content previews
 * - **Status**: Availability flag controlling interactivity
 * 
 * ## Usage Contexts:
 * - Current week placeholder (rewindAvailable = false)
 * - Current week completed rewind (rewindAvailable = true) 
 * - Historical rewind (always rewindAvailable = true)
 * 
 * ## Visual Mapping:
 * Each property directly corresponds to visual elements in the floating card:
 * - `label` → Primary color header text
 * - `title` → Bold/medium weight headline
 * - `message` → Body text description
 * - `start/end` → Date range with arrow separator
 * - `rewindAvailable` → Controls card styling and interactivity
 * 
 * @param message AI-generated greeting or description highlighting the week's content
 * @param rewindId Unique identifier for navigation and data retrieval
 * @param label Short descriptive identifier (e.g., "This Week", "Week of Nov 1-7")
 * @param title Main headline describing the rewind theme or highlights
 * @param start Start date of the rewind period (inclusive)
 * @param end End date of the rewind period (inclusive)
 * @param activities Future: Rich content blocks for photo/location previews
 * @param rewindAvailable Whether the rewind is fully processed and viewable
