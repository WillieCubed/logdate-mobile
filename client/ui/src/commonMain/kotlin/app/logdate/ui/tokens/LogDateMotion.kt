/**
 * The springs every LogDate surface moves with, on the phone and on the watch.
 *
 * A spring starts from the velocity it already has, so a control that follows a finger, such as
 * the record button sliding up to lock, never jumps when the finger lets go. Use [standard] for
 * anything that changes place or size, [quick] for small state changes such as a press, and
 * [expressive] only for the moment a screen confirms something, such as a recording locking.
