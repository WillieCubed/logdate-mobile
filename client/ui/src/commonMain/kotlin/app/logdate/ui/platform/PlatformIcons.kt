 * Cross-platform icon set. Each accessor returns a [Painter] so the iOS actual can hand back an
 * SF Symbol rasterized from `UIImage.systemImageNamed`, while Android and desktop continue to
 * render the Material vector counterpart.
 *
 * Callers prefer this object over `Icons.Default.*` for any icon that appears on iOS — it keeps
 * the visual language consistent with the host platform without forcing every site to branch
 * on [currentPlatform].
