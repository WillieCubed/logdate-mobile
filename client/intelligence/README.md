# `:client:intelligence`

**AI and machine learning features for intelligent journaling**

## Overview

Provides intelligent features like entry summarization, people extraction, and content analysis using AI services. Enhances the journaling experience with automatic insights and content understanding.

## Architecture

```

## Key Components

### Core Intelligence
- `EntrySummarizer.kt` - Entry content summarization
- `PeopleExtractor.kt` - People and entity extraction
- `OpenAiClient.kt` - OpenAI API integration
- `ClientsModule.kt` - AI service dependency injection

### Analysis Features
- Natural language processing
- Content categorization
- Sentiment analysis (planned)
- Topic extraction (planned)

## Features

### Content Summarization
- Automatic entry summarization
- Key point extraction
- Context-aware summaries
- Multiple summary lengths

### Entity Extraction
- People mentioned in entries
- Location identification
- Event recognition
- Relationship mapping

### Content Analysis
- Writing pattern recognition
- Mood detection from text
- Topic classification
- Habit identification

## Dependencies

### External AI Services
- **OpenAI API**: GPT models for text processing
- **Local ML Models**: On-device processing (planned)

### Core Dependencies
- `:client:networking` - API communication
- **Kotlinx Coroutines**: Async operations
- **Kotlinx Serialization**: API serialization

## Usage Examples

### Entry Summarization
```kotlin
val summarizer = EntrySummarizer(openAiClient)
val summary = summarizer.summarizeEntry(
    content = "Long journal entry text...",
    maxLength = 100
)
```

### People Extraction
```kotlin
val extractor = PeopleExtractor(openAiClient)
val people = extractor.extractPeople(
    content = "Had lunch with Alice and Bob today."
)
// Returns: ["Alice", "Bob"]
```

## Platform Considerations

### Privacy-First Approach
- Optional AI features (user consent required)
- Local processing when possible
- Data anonymization for cloud processing
- No persistent storage of AI service data

### Performance Optimization
- Intelligent batching of requests
- Result caching for repeated analysis
- Background processing for non-critical features
- Rate limiting compliance
