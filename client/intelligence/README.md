# `:client:intelligence`

**AI and machine learning features for intelligent journaling**

## Overview

Provides intelligent features like entry summarization, people extraction, and content analysis using AI services. Enhances the journaling experience with automatic insights and content understanding.

## Architecture

```

├── AI Service Clients
├── Content Analysis
├── Entity Extraction
├── Summarization Engine
└── Platform Integrations
```

## Key Components

### Core Intelligence
- `EntrySummarizer.kt` - Entry content summarization
- `PeopleExtractor.kt` - People and entity extraction
- `OpenAiClient.kt` - OpenAI API integration
- `ClientsModule.kt` - AI service dependency injection

### Analysis Features
- Natural language processing
- Content categorization
- Sentiment analysis (planned)
- Topic extraction (planned)

## Features

### Content Summarization
- Automatic entry summarization
- Key point extraction
- Context-aware summaries
- Multiple summary lengths

### Entity Extraction
- People mentioned in entries
- Location identification
- Event recognition
- Relationship mapping

### Content Analysis
- Writing pattern recognition
- Mood detection from text
- Topic classification
- Habit identification

## Dependencies

### External AI Services
- **OpenAI API**: GPT models for text processing
- **Local ML Models**: On-device processing (planned)

### Core Dependencies
- `:client:networking` - API communication
- **Kotlinx Coroutines**: Async operations
- **Kotlinx Serialization**: API serialization

## Usage Examples

### Entry Summarization
```kotlin
val summarizer = EntrySummarizer(openAiClient)
val summary = summarizer.summarizeEntry(
    content = "Long journal entry text...",
    maxLength = 100
)
```

### People Extraction
```kotlin
val extractor = PeopleExtractor(openAiClient)
val people = extractor.extractPeople(
    content = "Had lunch with Alice and Bob today."
)
// Returns: ["Alice", "Bob"]
```

## Platform Considerations

### Privacy-First Approach
- Optional AI features (user consent required)
- Local processing when possible
- Data anonymization for cloud processing
- No persistent storage of AI service data

### Performance Optimization
- Intelligent batching of requests
- Result caching for repeated analysis
- Background processing for non-critical features
- Rate limiting compliance

## Testing

### Test Coverage
The intelligence module has comprehensive unit tests covering all core functionality:

#### EntrySummarizer Tests (`EntrySummarizerTest.kt`)
- **10 test cases** covering:
  - Summary generation with various text inputs
  - Caching behavior (cache hits, misses, forced refresh)
  - Error handling and fallback responses
  - AI client integration and prompt validation
  - Edge cases (empty text, null responses, long text)

#### PeopleExtractor Tests (`PeopleExtractorTest.kt`)
- **13 test cases** covering:
  - Name extraction from various text formats
  - Complex names (titles, compound names, international names)
  - Caching and response processing
  - Edge cases (empty input, whitespace handling)
  - System prompt validation

#### OpenAI Client Tests (`OpenAiClientTest.kt`)
- **10 test cases** covering:
  - Data structure serialization and conversion
  - Message format transformation
  - Request/response object validation
  - Type-safe API integration

#### Text Processing Accuracy (`TextProcessingAccuracyTest.kt`)
- **8 integration test scenarios** with realistic journal content:
  - Daily life entries with social interactions
  - Work meetings and professional contexts
  - Family gatherings and relationships
  - Travel entries with international names
  - Medical appointments with titles
  - Large social events with many people
  - Emotional entries requiring context preservation
  - Achievement entries capturing positive sentiment

### Test Infrastructure

#### Fake Implementations
- **`FakeGenerativeAICache`**: Complete cache simulation with call tracking
- **`FakeGenerativeAIChatClient`**: Configurable AI client for deterministic testing
- **Features**: Error simulation, response customization, call verification

#### Testing Patterns
- **Coroutine Testing**: Uses `StandardTestDispatcher` for deterministic async behavior
- **Response Mocking**: Configurable AI responses for different test scenarios
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Empty inputs, malformed responses, network errors
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflows with realistic data

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all intelligence module tests
./gradlew :client:intelligence:test

# Test output shows comprehensive coverage
# 43 tests completed successfully
```

### Test Data Quality

The tests use realistic journal entry scenarios including:
- **Professional Context**: "Today's quarterly review meeting was intense..."
- **Family Events**: "Sunday dinner at Grandma's house was wonderful..."
- **Travel Experiences**: "First day in Tokyo was incredible!"
- **Medical Appointments**: "Had my annual checkup with Dr. Sarah Mitchell..."
- **Social Gatherings**: "Birthday party for Rachel was a blast!"

Each scenario validates:
- **Accuracy**: Correct extraction of people's names and relationships
- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining important contextual information
- **Edge Cases**: Handling of various text formats and edge conditions
- **Performance**: Efficient processing and caching behavior

### Test Quality Metrics
- **Unit Test Coverage**: All public APIs tested
- **Integration Coverage**: Realistic end-to-end workflows
- **Error Coverage**: Network failures, malformed responses, edge cases
- **Performance Testing**: Caching efficiency and response handling
