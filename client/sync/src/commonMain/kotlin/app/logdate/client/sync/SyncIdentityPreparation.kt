/**
 * Every note, journal, and draft is encrypted with a key derived from this device's identity
 * key, so a device without one fails every upload. Onboarding provisions it for new devices;
 * this covers the ones that finished onboarding back when nothing did.
 *
 * A device can also have no key because it *lost* one -- a reinstall, a restore onto a
 * different device -- while the account it signs back into already has data in the cloud
 * encrypted under the old key. Minting a fresh key in that case would look identical to
 * onboarding a new device, but it silently starts a second, unrelated identity: nothing
 * already in the cloud can ever be read again, and uploads from now on quietly diverge from
 * everything before them. So before minting anything, this first checks whether the identity
 * key manager can silently restore the key from its own device-transfer/cloud backup (see
 * [app.logdate.client.device.crypto.IdentityKeyBackupStore]) -- the common case for exactly
 * this scenario, needing no user interaction at all. Only when that backup is also empty does
 * this fall back to the mint-or-pause decision: mints when the account can be confirmed empty;
 * when it already has data, sync pauses with [SyncPausedReason.NEEDS_RECOVERY_PHRASE] instead
 * and waits for the phrase to be entered again, and when it cannot be determined (offline, a
 * server error), nothing happens this pass and the next sync attempt tries again.
