 * Stable identifiers for [PlaceResolutionResult] values.
 *
 * The on-device pipelines (event inference, ambient prompts) need a deterministic key to
 * look up familiarity records and dedupe places across runs. This helper centralizes the
 * key derivation so two callers can't drift on the encoding — a silent drift would mean a
 * "familiar" place suddenly becomes unfamiliar from one feature's perspective.
 *
 * Returns `null` for [PlaceResolutionResult.CoarseLocation] and
 * [PlaceResolutionResult.UnknownLocation] — both indicate the resolver had no semantic
 * anchor for the location, so callers should treat the stop as unattributable rather than
 * persist a key that means nothing.
