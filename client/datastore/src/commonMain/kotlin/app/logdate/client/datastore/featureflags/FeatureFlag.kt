/**
 * A feature that can be turned on or off at runtime.
 *
 * Every commit lands on `main`, so a feature that is not ready for users has to be invisible to
 * them rather than parked on a branch. A flag is how that is done: the code ships, the flag stays
 * off, and turning it on is a decision rather than a merge.
 *
 * A flag is a temporary thing. Once a feature ships to everyone, its flag and every branch on it
 * should be deleted -- a flag that nobody will ever flip is just a second way to read a constant.
 *
 * @property key The preference key the flag is stored under. Changing it silently resets everyone
 *   who had already set the flag, so treat it as permanent once released.
 * @property defaultEnabled Whether the feature is on for someone who has never set it. Incomplete
 *   work defaults to `false`; a flag that exists only as a kill switch for shipped behavior
 *   defaults to `true`.
