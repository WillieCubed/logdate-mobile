/**
 * Checks, before the recovery key signs anything, that the operation the server prepared is exactly
 * the change the person asked for: replace the server's key and nothing else.
 *
 * The recovery key ranks above the server's key, and an operation it signs cannot be undone by a
 * lower key, so a server that is compromised or wrong must not be able to get it to sign something
 * else, such as an operation that drops the recovery key or moves the handle. The device decodes the
 * operation and requires:
 *
 * - its canonical encoding to be exactly the bytes it is asked to sign;
 * - `prev` to be the head of the identity's history;
 * - the rotation keys to be this device's recovery key first, then the new server key, and nothing else;
 * - the verification method to be the new server key;
 * - the handle and services to be unchanged from the head, and the handle to be the identity's.
