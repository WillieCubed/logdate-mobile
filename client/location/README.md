## Key Components

### Core Location
- `ClientLocationProvider.kt` - Common location interface
- `AndroidLocationProvider.kt` - Android location implementation
- Platform-specific location services

### Location Features
- Real-time location tracking
- Place detection and recognition
- Location history management
- Geofencing for automatic triggers

## Features

### Location Tracking
- GPS and network-based positioning
- Battery-efficient location updates
- Configurable accuracy and frequency
- Background location tracking

### Place Detection
- Automatic place recognition
- Custom place creation and management

- Location data anonymization
- Local-only location storage option
- Location sharing controls

## Dependencies

### Platform Dependencies
- **Android**: Google Play Services Location
- **iOS**: Core Location framework
- **Desktop**: IP-based location (limited)

### Core Dependencies
- `:client:database` - Location data storage
- **Kotlinx Coroutines**: Reactive location updates

## Usage Patterns

### Location Tracking
```kotlin
val locationProvider = ClientLocationProvider()
locationProvider.locationUpdates.collect { location ->
    // Handle location update
    processLocationChange(location)
}
```

### Place Detection
```kotlin
val places = locationProvider.detectNearbyPlaces(location)
val currentPlace = places.firstOrNull { it.isWithinBounds(location) }
```

## Privacy Considerations

### Data Minimization
- Collect only necessary location data
- Automatic data retention policies
- Location precision adjustment
- Anonymous location analytics

### User Control
- Explicit location permission requests
- Granular privacy settings
- Location data export/deletion
- Transparent data usage disclosure

## Platform Features

### Android
- **Fused Location Provider**: Battery-efficient positioning
- **Geofencing API**: Location-based triggers
- **Places API**: Place detection and details
- **Activity Recognition**: Movement detection

### iOS
- **Core Location**: Native location services
- **MapKit**: Place search and details
- **Region Monitoring**: Geofencing capabilities
- **Visit Monitoring**: Significant location visits

### Desktop
- **IP Geolocation**: Approximate location
- **Manual Location**: User-specified locations
- **Time Zone Detection**: Automatic time zone updates
